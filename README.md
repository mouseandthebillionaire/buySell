# Buy! Sell!

A fast-paced multi-player stock trading game that uses analog telephones as game controllers. Watch a terminal full of charts, graphs and breaking news and make split second decisions to invest in stocks like, pizza, moms and gold. Shout “Buy!” or “Sell!” into your phone before your competitors do. Their transactions will affect the stock price. The player with largest portfolio at the end of the trading day wins.

Capitalism!
